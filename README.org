#+title: My tools

Some personal tools that are public so I can leech off of whatever
GitHub's offering for free.

* Tools
** Openwebui
[[./openwebui-setup.org][This org file]] is a literate file for running a simple Openwebui +
Ollama setup. I've stopped using this in favor of gptel.

** Amp Container
[[./my-amp-env.Dockerfile][This Dockerfile]] is a self-contained environment for running
[[https://ampcode.com/][amp]]. You'll need podman, and then run it like this in your project directory.
#+begin_src shell
  AMP_API_KEY=... /path/to/my-amp-env.Dockerfile
#+end_src

The default =$EDITOR= is Helix.
